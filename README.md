Art Portfolio Site for MCMT

A great friend of mine is an amazing artist and has sold a lot of her work, but doesn't have a central place that her art can call "home." Knowing that I've been working on websites, she's trusted me to design and create her site (an opportunity I've been itching to have for some time now). 

The site is still a working progress with hopes to be fully launched by March 22, but the current progress of the site can be viewed at http://79.170.40.173/sodaontheside.com/ (ignore the silly domain name. Just a silly inside joke between some friends and I :).
